# 24/7: The Game (BoardGameArena Edition)

Digital implementation of the board game, 24/7: The Game, on BoardGameArena's platform.

## TODO

List of ideas to implement prior to alpha release.

### Javascript
- Standardize all the ids, classes, etc so there is no concern about namespace collisions (i.e., prefix everything with tf7_)
- Review replay last turns (JS error happening)

### PHP
- Standardize all the ids, classes, etc so there is no concern about namespace collisions (i.e., prefix everything with tf7_)
- Implement zombie turn

### BGA
- Add docs/rules/etc
- Add required images
- Review pre-release checklist
